- **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Removes duplicate entries and standardizes data for better usability.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Provides insights using Power BI to explore therapist trends by expertise, cost, endorsements, and location.
- **Automated Execution**: The script is designed to handle large-scale scraping efficiently with error handling and delay mechanisms.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`, `re`, `tqdm`
- **Power BI**: Used for visualizing therapist data
- **Google Colab**: For running the script and handling large-scale data processing
