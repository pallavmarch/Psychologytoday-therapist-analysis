My name is Dr. Katherine (Katie) Kainer and I am a licensed psychologist based in San Antonio, TX. I am the owner of ReNew Psychological Services, PLLC, and provide virtual therapy to clients all over Texas. I work with adults who experience various difficulties, including depression, anxiety, social anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, PTSD, trauma, anger, stress, body image, relational, communication, life transition/adjustment, grief/loss, burnout, work stress, perfectionism, self-esteem, family conflict, chronic pain, neurocognitive, military/veteran-related, and college mental health concerns. We will work together to explore, process, learn, and build awareness and strategies to help manage these concerns in your daily life. I work from client-centered, cognitive-behavioral, emotion-focused, relational-cultural, and solution-focused approaches in therapy. I will tailor our treatment to meet your unique and specific needs. In this work, I have found a way to channel my enthusiasm for learning, a strong connection to people, and a powerful compassion for others into practice. I love being a psychologist and feel fortunate to be a part of my clients' journey towards growth.\",\n          \"As a counselor, I  come alongside people who are in a difficult place in their life. Earlier in my life I needed someone to walk with me during a hard time, and I found the counseling process to be life changing and life giving. It changed how I see and relate to life, people, God, and myself. If you are struggling with your relationships or marriage, if you battle with depression or anxiety, are lacking hope, grieving deeply, or if you just feel stuck, I would like the opportunity to walk alongside you and help you process what change and living life differently would look like for you. I bring over 28 years of counseling experience to the table and specialize in relationship issues, life transitions, and grief. Having studied with Drs. Larry Crabb and Dan Allender, I bring a Christian and relational approach to the process of change, looking at the human heart-- how we relate and what gets in the way of loving others well.\",\n          \"Our goal @ Mariposa Wellness Center is to help guide and connect you to the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cBest version of Yourself\\\".
